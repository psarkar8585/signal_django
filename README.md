Question 1: By default are django signals executed synchronously or asynchronously? Please support your answer with a code snippet that conclusively proves your stance. The code does not need to be elegant and production ready, we just need to understand your logic.


Answer: By default, Django signals are executed **synchronously**. This means when a signal is triggered, the code connected to the signal runs in the same process and thread as the code that triggered it.

*Code Example:*
#import post_save, receiver and MyModel
#post_save which is a built-in signal provided by Django.
#The receiver decorator is used to connect a function (the signal handler) to a signal.
#This import brings in your model, MyModel, which is presumably defined in your Django app's models.


python
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver
from myapp.models import MyModel

@receiver(post_save, sender=MyModel)
def my_handler(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    print("Signal received!")

Question 2: Do Django signals run in the same thread as the caller?


Answer: Yes, by default, Django signals run in the **same thread** as the caller, meaning that if the signal is triggered in the main thread, the connected handler runs in that same thread.


*Code Example: *
python
from threading import current_thread
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver
from myapp.models import MyModel

@receiver(post_save, sender=MyModel)
def my_handler(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    print(f"Signal running in thread: {current_thread().name}")

When an instance of MyModel is saved, it will print the current thread name.
